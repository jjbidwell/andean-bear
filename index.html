    <h1>The Magnificent Andean Bear</h1>

    <p>The Andean bear (also known as the spectacled bear), is a bear species originating in the Andes Mountain range of South America. It's range typically spreads from Venezuela to the very northern tip of Argentina</p>
    <p>The bear is easily identified by the distinct pattern on its face. Often times, this pattern loosely resembles a pair of glasses, hence the name "spectacled bear".</p>
    <p>Like many bears, Andean bears have a diverse diet, however they tend to be more herbivorous than other species of bear because of the environment they live in.</p>
